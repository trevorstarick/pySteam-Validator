Uses the SteamCMD.exe application by Valve.\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nIf you have Python 2.7.3 installed you can skip to part 3.\r\n\r\n1. Download [Python 2.7.3](http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7.3/)\r\n2. Install Python 2.7.3 and make sure that `C:\\Python27\\` is in your `$PATH`\r\n3. To run the program, copy `pysteam.py` to your Steam root directory (eg. `C:\\Program Files(x86)\\Steam\\`) and execute `python steam.py`\r\n\r\n**Bonus:**\r\n\r\n1. If you want to compile `pysteam.py` into an executable file download and install [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/) and run `build.py`\r\n2. Navigate to `dist` and copy everything to your Steam root directory\r\n3. Now you should be able to run `pysteam.exe`\r\n\r\n##Common Issues\r\n###pysteam.py\r\n* `Not in Steam root folder (eg. C:\\Program File (x86)\\Steam\\)!` - Move `pysteam.py` or `pysteam.exe` to wherever you installed Steam and the `steam.exe` executable is located.\r\n\r\n###setup.py\r\n* `ImportError: No module named py2exe` - Install [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/).\r\n\r\n###Steam\r\n* Steam isn't loading now or crashes! - Delete the `ClientRegistry.blob` file located inside your Steam root directory. This generaly fixes most Steam loading issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Donations\r\n**Bitcoin:** _1PLi4dHvvghyrCjm5fwnN7Ap1FwxrdWKVk_\r\n","google":"UA-39749545-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
